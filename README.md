#sfclock for Pebble

This is a customisable watchface for Pebble Time that displays time, date, weather, a custom text and a battery percent.

The master branch constains all the source files and the gh-pages hosts the configuration webpage.

The watchface was written in C and Javascript based on tutorials from developer.pebble.com. 
The customisation webpage was based on Slate from https://github.com/pebble/slate.

The font used is made by Nathan McArthur from http://www.dafont.com/other-f.font.

This watchface was made for CS50x 2015 Final Project by Bogdan Orzea.
